    <h1>About Me.</h1>
    <p>Hola! I’m Luis — a Full Stack Programmer, designer, and all-around creative technologist based in the U.S. I’ve been building apps, games, and interactive experiences since college, where I discovered my love for turning ideas into working (and beautiful) products. Over the years, I’ve shipped mobile games played by millions, systems that keep users coming back, and mentored up and coming devs along the way. Whether I’m coding in C#, prototyping in Unity, 3D modeling in Blender or nerding out over UI polish, I thrive at the intersection of tech and creativity. I also have a soft spot for teaching, building tools that empower designers, and making sure the whole team has fun while shipping great work.</p>
